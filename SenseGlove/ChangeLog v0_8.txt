# Changelog
All notable changes to the SenseGlove Prefabs will be documented in this file.

You are currently using version 0.8.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [v0.8] - 2017-07-11
Grabscript overhaul

###	Added
-	Get() function to the GloveData.handmodel, which allows the user get the right information without knowledge of Anatomy.
-	SenseGlove_Interactable, an abstract class, activated by the GrabScript, which determines how an object behaves when grabbed by a SenseGlove.
-	SenseGlove_Grabable. attach this to an object that you wish the SenseGlove to pick up.
-	SenseGlove_PhysGrab is no longer responsible for having the grabable object follow. Only the 

### Changed
-	SenseGlove_Touch now only responds to GameObjects with a SenseGlove_Interactable script attached.
-	Documentation Update.

### Fixed
-	The twisting section of the left hand thumb was given the wrong sign (+ instead of -), causing an unnatural looking hand.



## [v0.7] - 2017-07-06
Events and Usability improvements.

### Added
-	SenseGlove_Keybinds script. Add this to any GameObject that has a SenseGlove_Object attached to perform calibration via the keyboard.

### Changed
-	SenseGlove_PhysGrab now keeps track of the velocity of its grabReference, allowing us to throw objects. Angular Veclocity is missing still.
-	SenseGlove_Object now controls which calibration methods are called via the NextCalibrationStep() function.
-	CalibrationFinished event added to SenseGlove_Object, which fires when the finger calibration completes. 
	This is an indication that one's hand model should adjust to the new lengths.
-	GloveLoaded event added to SenseGlove_Object, which fires one all kinematic data has been loaded from the glove.
-	The SenseGlove_Wireframe now only destroys its 'preview' child on StartUp, meaning that developers can safely add other GameObjects to the Wireframe.
-	IMU Compensation is now only applied to gloves with firmware versions of 2.19 and lower. Gloves 12 to 25 should work with any version of the SDK.

### Fixed
-	Bug where the global z coordinate of the hand palm was flipped instead of the local z coordinate, which would occur if the position of the prefab was not (0,0,0).

### Planned
-	The next version of the unitypackage will switch up how the SenseGlove Interacts with other GameObjects: 
	The SenseGlove_Physgrab script will only determine when an interaction with a SenseGlove_Interactable object starts and ends.
	This SenseGlove_Interactables, which will range from grabable objects to Drop Zones to doors, will determine their own behaviour, much like the 
	popular toolkit VRTK.
	These features are planned for release before 17-06-017.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------


## [v0.6] - 2017-06-22
Bug Fixes and GrabScript improvements.

### Changed
-	SenseGlove_PhysGrab can now check if the fingers are 'flexed'. It will no longer attemt to pick up any object with a 'flexed' finger.
-	SenseGlove_PhysGrab is now able to pick up objects between the hand palm and finger as well.

### Fixed
-	SenseGlove will no longer 'stick' to objects wich an open hand, due to the afforementioned 'flex' detection.
-	SenseGloveCs.dll now inverts the y coordinate of its relative position when connected to a left hand.
-	Inverted the Unity z-coordinate of the hand palm model in case of a left hand. This corresponds with the y-coordinate in the SenseGloveCs DLL.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------


## [v0.5] - 2017-06-20
Improvements after first Demo feedback.

### Changed
-	ManualRelease() on the SenseGlove_Physgrab, which will cause it to let go of any object it is holding. The script will no longer pick up any new items for a specified time.
-	The CalibrateWrist method in the SenseGlove_Wireframe() now uses the foreArm model as a reference point.
-	SenseGlove_Physgrab now contains OnGrab and OnRelease events, which can be delegated by other classes.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------


## [v0.4] - 2017-06-15
Physics-Based Grab Script

### Added
-	SenseGlove_Touch Script, used to determine which GameObject if being touched by a collider.
-	SenseGlove_PhysGrab Script, which will pick up objects with a Rigidbody if they are being touched by the thumb and at least one other finger.
	For now, it sets a boolean to true when it picks up an object, and when it releases one. These will be replaced by events later.
-	PhysicsScene as a test for the SenseGlove_PhysGrab Script and SenseGlove_Object on other PCs.
-	WireFrame_Grab Prefab. Similar to the original WireFrame Prefab, but with a properly setup SenseGlove_PhysGrab Script attached.
-	ResetPosition script, as a helpful addition to objects that will be manipulated by the SenseGlove.

### Changed
-	When SenseGlove_WireFrame detects that a SenseGlove_PhysGrab script is attached to the same GameObject, it will automatically create colliders and assign these to the grabscript.
-	SenseGlove_WireFrame now calls CalibrateWrist() function on Setup().

### Fixed
-	The Pickup / Tracking script would fail if trackedObject and WireFrame prefab were not facing the same orientation on Setup(). 	


--------------------------------------------------------------------------


## [v0.3] - 2017-06-13
Improved Tracking

### Changed
-	The SenseGlove Package is now contained in its own folder.
-	Tracking Software now correcly mimics orientation and a proper offset.

### Removed
-	BuildScene, since it will be used to create the prefabs. Separate Scenes showing off each functionality will be added in the future.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------


## [v0.2] - 2017-06-13
Experimental GameObject tracking of the wireframe model.

### Added
-	BuildScene, which serves as an example on how to add a SenseGlove to your scene.
-	GloveTester Script which allows the user to perform wrist calibration and turn the glove / hand models on or off using keybrad keys.
-	AnchorPoint enumerator which determines where the trackedObject connects to.
-	SenseGloveCs.xml file, which contains the (auto-generated) documentation of the SenseGloveCs.dll.

### Changed
-	Wireframe Prefab now has a full preview, including lower arm and (simplified) fingers. The live version now also contains a lower arm.
	All children of the Prefab are assumed to be part of the preview and destroyed on StartUp() except for the Wrist and Lower Arm.
-	SenseGlove_WireFrame now has a public GameObject trackedObject. Its wrist or lower arm will will attempt to follow this object. Still a work in progress.
-	SenseGloveCs.dll now has a defaultValue for GloveStartPosition.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------


## [v0.1] - 2017-06-12
The first iteration of the UnityPackage. Is able to reliably connect to a SenseGlove and see the Kinematics live.

### Added
-	SenseGlove_Object Script, which ensures a proper connection with one SenseGlove and access to its GloveData. 
-	SenseGlove_Debugger Script, which allows one to access the debug messages within the DLL.
- 	SenseGlove_Wireframe Script, which uses the glove- and handPositions on a SenseGlove_Object to create a wireframe model of the hand and animate it.
- 	SenseGlove_Util Script, which contains methods to convert between our Right-Handed coordinate system to Unity's Left-Handed Vector3 and Quaternion classes and vice versa.
	Also contains some ToString methods to get greater decimal precision from Debug.Log.
-	WireFrame Prefab, which uses a SenseGlove_Object and SenseGlove_Wireframe to show the SenseGlove in 3D.
-	Simple Unity Materials to distinguish between the points of the hand/glove, and the segments of the glove/hand.
